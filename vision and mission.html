As a FILIPINO SCHOOL, ICCT Colleges adheres to the educational provisions of the Philippines Constitution. It has a virtal role helping Filipino students actualize their indigenous values, qualities and potentials so that together with their fellowmen, they may contribute to the building of the Filipino nation.

To these ends, ICCT Colleges includes in its curriculum, subjects designed to instill in the students an awareness of home and community life, particularly the rights and duties of citizenship, in the hope of making them responsible Filipinos. It emphasizes self-discipline drawn from within rather than imposed it, in the hope of enabling them to help in the development of national strength.
